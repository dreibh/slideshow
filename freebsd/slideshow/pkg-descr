SlideShow is a command-line tool to generate standards-compliant XHTML-1.1 
presentations from a set of image files. It can be used to easily generate 
online photo albums, including JavaScript-based slideshows. Particularly, this 
program is intended to be also used in scripts, which automatically create or 
update slideshows.
