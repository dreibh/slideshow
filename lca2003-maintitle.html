This page contains the photos I have taken during my travel to the
<a href="http://www.linux.org.au/conf/2003">Linux Conference Australia (LCA 2003)</a>
in Perth, Western Australia.
My paper "High Availability using Reliable Server Pooling" that I have presented
at this conference can be found
<a href="http://www.exp-math.uni-essen.de/~dreibh/publications/RSerPool-Paper.ps.gz">here!</a>
<br />
I combined my travel to the conference with 6 days of holiday in Sydney, New South Wales.
