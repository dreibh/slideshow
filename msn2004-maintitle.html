This page contains the photos I have taken during my travel to the
<a href="http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/research/ngn/cgi-bin/msn.cgi">Multi-Service Networks Conference (MSN 2004)</a>
at The Cosener's House in Abingdon/Oxfordshire, England. At this conference, I presented
some research results about Reliable Server Pooling. The presentation slides are
here: <a href="http://tdrwww.exp-math.uni-essen.de/dreibholz/rserpool/MSN2004-Final-with-Examples.pdf">PDF format</a> and
<a href="http://tdrwww.exp-math.uni-essen.de/dreibholz/rserpool/MSN2004-Final-with-Examples.sxi">OpenOffice format</a>.
I combined my travel to the conference with 2 days of holiday in London, England.
